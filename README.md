<h1>PC Parts Image Classification</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on the classification of images depicting various PC parts using machine learning techniques. By training a model on a dataset of labeled images, we aim to accurately classify new images into categories such as CPU, GPU, RAM, motherboard, etc.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset comprises images of different PC parts collected from various sources. Each image is labeled with the corresponding part category, allowing for supervised learning.</p>

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>
<p>We employ a deep learning architecture, likely a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to effectively capture the intricate features of PC parts from images. The model will be trained on the dataset to learn the distinctive characteristics of each part.</p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>TensorFlow / PyTorch (Choose one)</li>
    <li>scikit-learn</li>
    <li>OpenCV</li>
    <li>Jupyter Notebooks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Ensure the dataset is properly organized with images categorized into folders by part type.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Use the provided Jupyter Notebook or scripts to train the model on the dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
    <li><strong>Inference:</strong> Apply the trained model to classify new images of PC parts.</li>
</ol>
